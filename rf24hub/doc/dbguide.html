<H1>Rf24Hub Database Guide</H1>
<p>This is a compleate guide to set up your database (MariaDB) and to install the tables you will need.
Words in capital letter must be replaced with real content. That means PASSWORD with your password, HOSTNAME with the real hostname,...</p>
<H2>Create Database and User</h2>
Open a terminal on your host:<br>
<pre>
cd <my project dir>/RF24Hub
sudo mysql

create database rf24hub;
create user rf24hubuser identified by "PASSWORD";
grant all on rf24hub.* to rf24hubuser identified by "PASSWORD";
flush privileges;
exit
</pre>
<H2>Create Tables</H2>
Now log in as the new user you just created:
<pre>
mysql -u rf24hubuser -p rf24hub < database/create_tab.sql
# Now you have to enter your password
# After that the tables will be created
</pre>
<H2>Insert some Testdata</H2>
Here we will fill the database with the pure minimum you need to run.<br>
After the next script you have the following items:<br>
Node: 100<br>
Sensor: 100<br>
Gateway: 1<br>
<pre>
mysql -u rf24hubuser -p rf24hub < database/fill_test_data.sql
# Now you have to enter your password
# After that the tables will be filled with data for 1 node and 1 sensor
</pre>
Now you have to update your gateway hostname. If you have a FritzBox it is HOSTNAME.fritz.box.
<pre>
mysql -u rf24hubuser -p rf24hub

MariaDB [rf24hub]>update gateway set gw_name = 'HOSTNAME.WITH.DOMAINE' where gw_no = 1;
MariaDB [rf24hub]>exit
</pre>
<H2>Cleanup the Database</H2>
If you testing is finished you can remove the test data by running this script:<br>
<pre>
mysql -u rf24hubuser -p rf24hub < database/remove_test_data.sql
# Now you have to enter your password
# After that the tables will be filled with data for 1 node and 1 sensor
</pre>
